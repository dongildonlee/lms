hospital will have more days on which 60\% or more of the births are boys?

at least three television sets. Let $C$ be the event “at least two analog clocks”

course \emph{given} that they have a tattoo, or the probability that someone has
a tattoo \emph{given} that they have taken a college course?
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The probability of college $\mid$ tattoo is greater.
  \item The probability of tattoo $\mid$ college is greater.
  \item The two probabilities are equal.
  \item This cannot be answered without knowing $P(\text{college and tattoo})$.

  \item[III.] A randomly selected teenager who eats breakfast is a high school senior.
\end{itemize}
Which order best compares these probabilities?

If the probability of a motorist having a minor accident during the year is $0.2$ and of having a major accident is $0.05$, how much can the insurance company expect to make on a policy? \answer{D}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Yes, because $\dfrac{1,000,000}{0.66} = 1,515,152$, which is less than $7,500,000$.
  \item No, because your expected winnings are only $0.14$.
  \item Yes, because $\dfrac{7,500,000}{1+5+20} = 288,642$.
  \item No, because $1,052,000 < 7,500,000$.
  \item Yes, because $\dfrac{1,052,000}{26} = 40,462$.

\item The auditor working for a veterinary clinic calculates that the mean annual cost of medical care for dogs is \$98 with a standard deviation of \$25 and that the mean annual cost of medical care for a dog–cat household (one dog and one cat) is \$212 with a standard deviation of \$39. Assuming expenses for dogs and cats are independent for such households, what are the mean annual cost of medical care for \emph{cats} and its standard deviation? \answer{C}

The empty boxes alone weigh an average of $1.0$ ounce with a standard deviation of $0.2$ ounces. What are the mean and standard deviation of the \emph{total donut-hole weight per box}? (Assume independence of box and contents.) \answer{D}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $E(\text{Donut hole})=0.3\ \text{oz}$ $SD(\text{Donut hole})=0.0063\ \text{oz}$
