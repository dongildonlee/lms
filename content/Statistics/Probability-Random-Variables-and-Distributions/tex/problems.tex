\item Seventy percent of American households own an outdoor grill. Let the random variable $G$ represent the number of randomly selected households surveyed to find one with an outdoor grill. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the mean of $G$? \answer{C}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A value randomly selected from the distribution of $G$ is expected to be $1.43$.
  \item In repeated sampling from the distribution of $G$, the average of the values will approach $0.7$.
  \item In repeated sampling from the distribution of $G$, the average of the values will approach $1.43$.
  \item The probability is $0.7$ that a value randomly selected from the distribution of $G$ will be close to $1.43$.
  \item For a sample of values randomly selected from the distribution of $G$, the average of the sample will vary from $1.43$ by an average of $0.782$.
