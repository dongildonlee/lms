\item Which of the following is a true statement? \answer{A}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The area under a normal curve is always equal to 1, no matter what the mean and standard deviation are.
  \item All bell-shaped curves are normal distributions for some choice of $\mu$ and $\sigma$.
  \item The smaller the standard deviation of a normal curve, the lower and more spread out the graph.
  \item Depending upon the value of the standard deviation, normal curves with different means may be centered around the same number.
  \item Depending upon the value of the standard deviation, the mean and median of a particular normal distribution may be different.
\end{enumerate}

\item Populations $P_1$ and $P_2$ are normally distributed and have identical means. However, the standard deviation of $P_1$ is twice the standard deviation of $P_2$. What can be said about the percentage of observations falling within two standard deviations of the mean for each population? \answer{E}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The percentage for $P_1$ is twice the percentage for $P_2$.

  \item The percentage for $P_2$ is greater than but not twice as great as the percentage for $P_1$.
  \item The percentages are identical.

\item The mean and standard deviation of the sample data collected on a continuous variable $x$ are $10$ and $5$, respectively. The following table shows the relative frequencies of the data in the given intervals. Based on the table, do the data support using a normal model to approximate population characteristics? \answer{D}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Interval} & \textbf{Relative frequency} \\
\hline
$-5 \le x < 0$   & $0.03$ \\
$0 \le x < 5$    & $0.12$ \\
$5 \le x < 10$   & $0.35$ \\
$10 \le x < 15$  & $0.34$ \\
$15 \le x < 20$  & $0.14$ \\
$20 \le x < 25$  & $0.02$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item No, because some values are negative.
  \item No, because the relative frequency distribution doesnâ€™t follow the empirical rule.
  \item Yes, because the sum of the relative frequencies is $1.00$.
  \item Yes, because the relative frequency distribution roughly follows the empirical rule.
  \item This cannot be answered without knowing the sample size.
